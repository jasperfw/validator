# Jasper FW - Data Interface

Current Stability: **Beta**

The Data Inteface Library provides a range of utilities for interacting with data, from database access classes wrapping
PDO for various database systems, to automated data modeling and management classes, to a powerful form building and
validation system. Put together, these tools provide the ability to model a database table and manage the data therin
with a simple PHP array.

## Features

- Automatically generate forms, form validation, and database operations from simple PHP array definitions.
- Integrate with popular database engines (MySQL and MS Server currently, partial DB2 support, more coming soon.)
- Simple, security-minded input validation
